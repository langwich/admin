# Terence's original mail to Olga (as a memo):

We are planning to design/build a computer language with multiple implementations: generating LLVM, translating to C, generating our own bytecode. Then weâ€™ll implement the VM for the bytecode with a sophisticated garbage collector. The language will be likely pure functional and include immutable data structure implementations as part of its library.

We can add some parallel operator implementation for vectors/matrices too.

Brainstorming:

# Initial thoughts of the language

1. Statically typed, although not necessarily explicitly typed.
2. Translated to other language source (like C) or LLVM IR.
3. Could be run on a virtual machine (thus has its own bytecode).
4. Source-to-source translation and interpreter version support garbage collection. (GC for LLVM-based version is to be determined.)
5. Has pure-functional traits, like built-in immutable data structures and vector operations (that run on GPUs).
6. Support for bridge to other languages like (JAVA, Python).

# Syntax and semantics

Symbols are identifiers `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]*` arithmetic operators, parentheses, and other syntactic stuff.

A file is a script with statements and function definition at the outermost level.

Whitespace not significant except as separator between symbols. Newline and semicolon are not used to separate statements. I.e., the following is ok:

```javascript
x = 1 x = x + 1
```

and means same thing as

```javascript
x = 1
x = x + 1
```

ANTLR parsers can handle this as it's not ambiguous.

Comments are `//` and `/*...*/` like Java/C++.

## Expressions

The basics; ints, floats, strings

```javascript
var x = 1	       // type inference of int
var y = x*2.34   // type inference of float
print(abs(y))
var z = "hi"     // strings are immutable
```

Vectors of floats, indexed from 1 not 0.

```javascript
var X = [1, 2.3, 99.0024] // vectors are always floats
print(X*3)       // overload operators for vec-scalar, vec-vec
print(X+X)
print(X . X)     // dot product; period with spaces around it
sin(3.14)
sin(X)           // like R and numpy, apply sin() to all X
```

### Operators

`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, `.`, `:` (slice operator for vectors)

## Statements

```javascript
if (<expr>) <stat>
if (<expr>) <stat> else <stat>
```

```javascript
while ( <expr> ) <stat>
```

```javascript
{ <statement>+ '}'
```

```javascript
var id = <expr>
```

```javascript
return <expr>
```

```javascript
x = <expr>
X[<expr>] = <expr>
```

## Functions

### Syntax

```javascript
func dub(x : int) : int { return x*2 }
```

### Side-effect free

* Semantics are pass-by-value to/from functions. E.g., no way to swap two arguments like swap(x,y).
* Function calls have no side-effects; i.e., they cannot alter parameters or globals.
* However, a function *can* alter any data that is visible/accessible only to that function.

The implementation can use pass-by-reference and then copy-on-write for data altered within a function for efficiecy (avoid copying data each time to/from a function). Example:

```javascript
X = [1,2,3]
func f(X : []) {  // [] is both "empty vector" and typename
    X = 2*X       // X points to new copy of X with 2*X in it
    g(X)
}

func g(X : []) {
    print(X[1])   // prints "2"
}

f(X)
print(X[1])       // prints "1"
```

```javascript
func f(X : []) {  // [] is both "empty vector" and typename
    X[0] = 99     // X points to new copy of X with X[0] changed
}

f(X)
print(X[1])       // prints "1"
```

Disallow nested functions.
